        <h3>No Country for Old Men</h3>
        <p>In rural Texas, welder and hunter Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) discovers the remains of several drug runners who have all
      killed each other in an exchange gone violently wrong. Rather than report the discovery to the police, Moss decides to
      simply take the two million dollars present for himself. This puts the psychopathic killer, Anton Chigurh (Javier
      Bardem), on his trail as he dispassionately murders nearly every rival, bystander and even employer in his pursuit of
      his quarry and the money. As Moss desperately attempts to keep one step ahead, the blood from this hunt begins to flow
      behind him with relentlessly growing intensity as Chigurh closes in. Meanwhile, the laconic Sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Tommy
      Lee Jones) blithely oversees the investigation even as he struggles to face the sheer enormity of the crimes he is
      attempting to thwart.</p>
